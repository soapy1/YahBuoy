 *
 * So this is what you do;
 *    when you get home test it, treating it like a regular dc motor to make sure it works
 *    then set it up with the h-bridge
 *    write a program for it based on the examples (smoething simple)
 *    tomorrow hook it up with the arduino (remove everything else) and make sure the program
 *        works
 *    celebrate when it does work
 *
 *    while you are taking care of the electrical stuff, get the other peeps to do the mech 
 *        stuff
 *
 *    update the blog
 *
 *    DONE!  Go celebrate life.
